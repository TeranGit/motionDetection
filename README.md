## What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and accelerates the use of machine perception in various commercial products.

## How to Use
To use this motion detection script:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.9.13 and OpenCV installed.
3. Run the `motionDetector.py` script.
4. You can replace `vtest.avi` with your own video file or use a live video feed.
